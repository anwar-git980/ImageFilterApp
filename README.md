# Image Filter Application

![OpenCV Logo](https://opencv.org/assets/images/opencv-logo-small.png) ![NumPy Logo](https://numpy.org/images/logo.svg)

This Python script allows you to apply various filters (e.g., sharpen, invert) to images in a specified directory and save the filtered images to an output directory. It is a simple yet powerful tool for batch-processing images with custom filters.

---

## Features
- **Batch Processing**: Apply filters to all images in a directory at once.
- **Custom Filters**: Includes built-in filters like sharpen and invert, with the ability to add more.
- **User-Friendly**: Prompts for source and destination directories at runtime.
- **Error Handling**: Checks for valid directories and skips unreadable images.

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ImageFilterApp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ImageFilterApp
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python image_filter.py
   ```
2. Enter the path to the source directory containing your images.
3. Enter the path to the destination directory where filtered images will be saved.
4. The script will process all `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.jpeg` files in the source directory and save the filtered images in subfolders within the destination directory.

---

## Example
### Input Directory Structure
```
source/
â”œâ”€â”€ image1.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ image2.png
```

### Output Directory Structure
```
destination/
â”œâ”€â”€ image1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sharpen.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ invert.png
â”œâ”€â”€ image2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sharpen.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ invert.png
```

---

## Available Filters
- **Sharpen**: Enhances the edges of the image.
- **Invert**: Inverts the colors of the image.

You can easily add more filters by defining new functions and adding them to the `filter_names` and `filters` lists in the `apply_filters` function.
